### The Social Census - 1st Runners-Up

<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/hglogo.png" alt="HackForGood Logo" style="width:200px"/> </span>Hack For Good 2021 was a hackathon organized by Developer Student Club (DSC) NUS, that seeks to inspire students to learn and use technology for social causes. </p>

I think what drew me specifically to Hack For Good was the fact that it posed real-world problem statements from NPOs in Singapore, and specifically targeted at social good. 
Many of us, including myself, seek to effect positive change in the world, and this seemed like a good opportunity to marry technical knowledge and social impact.

Our team chose the problem statement from NUS OSA: 
<blockquote>How can we tap on technology to get youths to learn, understand and appreciate diversity and participate in creating a more inclusive space?</blockquote>

Our solution, **The Social Census**, is a **simple, fun-to-use question-and-answer platform that provokes thought and discussion about social issues involving diversity in Singapore, by illuminating the differences in our views and experiences.** 

### Reflections
My role in this project was to analyze the situation and come up with a simple and elegant solution (problem analysis and ideation), then craft our message to our audience such that they see our beliefs (pitch deck and presentation scripting). 

For me, I think the biggest difficulty was coming up with a solution that we really believed in. I think we got the approach wrong in our first few attempts, **looking at what was cool, what we wanted to code, instead of analysing the problem first**. Basically, we did things backwards. Looking back, I knew something was wrong when I found myself unconvinced whilst explaining our solution to my friends haha. So with not much time left, we had to pull the brakes, take a good look at the problem statement afresh, and rethink our entire solution. Thank God for hardworking teammates that made The Social Census work out in the end :\"). 

Thus, I especially resonated with the comments made by one of the judges: 
<blockquote>Solve for the user first, and a deep answer will most likely emerge as creative to everyone else. If you solve for creativity first, you end up force-fitting the answer onto the problem. - Jeremy Au</blockquote>
