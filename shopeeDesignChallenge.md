Grand Champion of Singapore's first Product Management and Design Competition. We were tasked to design a product feature to help maintain Shopee's lead in the E-commerce market.

Our feature, ShopeeList, focused on making it easier to share multiple products, so as to build up Shopee's social network. Team Simple Pleasures clinched Grand Champions (Student's Category) out of the 700+ teams that participated.

Gained experience with conducting market/user analysis, building interactive prototypes in Figma, creating user flows in Overflow, and the art of making simple presentations.
