### Bamboo - Personal Finance Tracker

Bamboo (v1.4) is a simple desktop app for managing personal finance, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), and targeted at college students. If you can type fast, Bamboo v1.4 can get your financial management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Bamboo was a group project under CS2103, Software Engineering. 

Learnt **good software engineering design patterns, and good practices** such as unit testing and Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) that enables us to write scalable, reliable and maintainable code. 
As team leader, the module was also a good opportunity to hone my project management and leadership skills.
