My partner, Le Hue Man, and I developed a turn-based strategy game, Elsewhere, in Unity Engine over the course of our 3-month summer break, spending about 500 hours each on the project.
We were heavily inspired by classic titles like Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem. 

Creating a game required wearing multiple hats - being a developer, designer, and storywriter all at once. Of course, I had the privilege of working with Man, who came up with beautifully designed character sprites and maps, breathing life into Elsewhere. 

As for me, some of my more notable contributions are: 
* Directing development cycle using AGILE methodology (user profiling, automated testing, user acceptance testing) and Kanban boards.
* Implementing pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*).
* Designing Enemy AI.
* Implementing software design patterns.
* Game design and technical design documentation.
* Crafting plot and dialogue.

Under the guidance of our mentor, Candiie (who we really can't thank enough!), we were awarded the Judgeâ€™s Choice Award, the highest accolade given to the 3 out of 383 teams, evaluated based on quality of features, documentation, testing, and software engineering practices.

**We are proud to present to you, Elsewhere. Please play it and experience the magic for yourself :D**
