Hi, my name is Maxx (yes, really!), and I'm passionate about building quality products that have positive social impact. What does that mean? Well, simply put, I want to harness technology to help others, and I have been exploring the end-to-end product development process - from product management, marketing, UI/UX Design, to software engineering. These pursuits have helped me understand how different puzzle pieces fit into the picture of building high-quality, purposeful products that bring value to the user.
Empathy for users, technical expertise, and strong communication skills - that's what I bring to the team!

I'm currently pursuing undergraduate studies at NUS in Computer Science, and will be graduating in 2023. I'm also a proud alumnus of Tembusu College!

Outside of work, I enjoy taking long walks through nature, a thought-provoking film, and actively play volleyball and ultimate frisbee!
