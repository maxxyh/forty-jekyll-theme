Hi, my name is Maxx (yes, really!), and I'm passionate about building quality products that have positive social impact. What does that mean? Well, simply put, I want to harness technology to help others, and I'm excited to explore the end-to-end product development process - from product management, marketing, UI/UX Design, to software engineering - and understand how they all fit into the big picture of bring value to a user.

I'm currently pursuing undergraduate studies at NUS in Computer Science, and will be graduating in 2023.  

Outside of work, I enjoy chill music, a thought-provoking film, and actively play volleyball and ultimate frisbee!
